to plot the fleets mpg i created new dataframes containing the fleets and an ID for the cars (called number).
The same way as in salaries.py i created the scattergraphs and the histogramms.
then i used the methodes in bootstrap.py to calculate the standart derivation bounds for different sizes of the bootstrap samples.
Then i ploted it.

Here are the plots:
Current Fleet:

![logo](./histogram.png?raw=true)
New Fleet:
![logo](./scaterplot2.png?raw=true)
![logo](./histogram2.png?raw=true)
Bootstraps (first current, then new):
![logo](./bootstrap_confidence_current.png?raw=true)
![logo](./bootstrap_confidence_new.png?raw=true)
